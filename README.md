**Title: Simple React Todo App**

**Description:**

This is a simple React Todo application that I developed as a learning project to improve my understanding of state management in React. This application serves as a practical demonstration of how to create, manage, and manipulate state within a React application.

**Key Features:**

- **Create Todos:** You can add new tasks to your to-do list using the "Create" button. Just type in your task, hit "Create," and it will be added to the list.

- **Edit Todos:** Each task in the list can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button. This feature allows you to modify the text of an existing task.

- **Delete Todos:** If you no longer need a task, you can easily remove it from your list by clicking the "Delete" button associated with each task.

- **Mark as Completed:** To keep track of completed tasks, you can mark them as done by checking the associated checkboxes.

**Learning Objectives:**

While developing this Todo application, I aimed to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **State Management:** Gain a better understanding of state management in React and how to update and synchronize state across multiple components.

2. **Component Composition:** Learn how to structure the application using separate components, each responsible for a specific task, to create a more organized and maintainable codebase.

3. **User Interaction:** Implement various user interactions such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as marking tasks as completed.

4. **React Hooks:** Explore and utilize React hooks, including `useState`, to manage component-level state.

5. **Styling:** Apply basic styling and layout techniques to create a visually appealing user interface.

**Technologies Used:**

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

**Usage:**
